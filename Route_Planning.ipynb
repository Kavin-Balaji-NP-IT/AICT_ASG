            "1. BREADTH-FIRST SEARCH (BFS):\n",
            "   Advantages:\n",
            "   - Guarantees shortest path in terms of number of stations (hops)\n",
            "   - Complete: will find a solution if one exists\n",
            "   - Simple to implement\n",
            "   \n",
            "   Disadvantages:\n",
            "   - Does not consider edge weights (travel time)\n",
            "   - High memory usage (stores all nodes at current level)\n",
            "   - Expands many unnecessary nodes\n",

            "2. DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH (DFS):\n",
            "   Advantages:\n",
            "   - Low memory usage (only stores path to current node)\n",
            "   - Fast for deep graphs\n",

            "   Advantages:\n",
            "   - Often faster than BFS/DFS due to heuristic guidance\n",
            "   - Expands fewer nodes by focusing on goal\n",

            "COST FUNCTION:\n",

        "   Advantages:\n",
        "   - Guarantees shortest path in terms of number of stations (hops)\n",
        "   - Complete: will find a solution if one exists\n",
        "   - Simple to implement\n",
        "\n",
        "   Disadvantages:\n",
        "   - Does not consider edge weights (travel time)\n",
        "   - High memory usage (stores all nodes at current level)\n",
        "   - Expands many unnecessary nodes\n",
        "\n",
        "2. DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH (DFS):\n",
        "   Advantages:\n",
        "   - Low memory usage (only stores path to current node)\n",
        "   - Fast for deep graphs\n",

        "   - Does not guarantee optimal path\n",

        "3. GREEDY BEST-FIRST SEARCH (GBFS):\n",
        "   Advantages:\n",
        "   - Often faster than BFS/DFS due to heuristic guidance\n",
        "   - Expands fewer nodes by focusing on goal\n",
        "   - Uses domain knowledge (coordinates)\n",

        "   Advantages:\n",
        "   - Guarantees optimal path (with admissible heuristic)\n",

        "   - Balances actual cost and estimated remaining cost\n",

        "   - Requires good heuristic function\n",

        "COST FUNCTION:\n",
        "- Base cost: Travel time between stations (2-4 minutes)\n",
